# reactStarter


# Hooks
1) its just a local variable
2) don't create hook in local variable
# react router { createBrowerRouter, RouterProvider, Outlet, Link, useReactError }
    i)how to configure them
    ii)how to handle the error explain in with Error.tsx
    iii) why we use Link component

    1)Single Page Application :: Doesn't reload the page
        we have to use  `Link component from react-router-dom` instead of <a> tag
        but at the end Link is <a> tag
    2)Two types of Rendering
        i)Client side 
        ii)Server side
    3) All the childern going to the outlet



### Class Based Component
1) You should have to extend React.Component
2) You have to write render()
